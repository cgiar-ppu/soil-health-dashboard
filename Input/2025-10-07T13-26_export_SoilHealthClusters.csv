As a result, shifts from the prevailing fallow system to permanent cultivation lead to soil degradation. The present study aimed to quantify the fluxes of biomass, nutrients, and nutrient balances from different fertilizer sources to de-risk the challenges related to agriculture and the environment in Mali. A farm household survey was conducted over two years (July 2018 to June 2020) with 45 households. The survey enabled us to categorize farm households into three typologies: high resource endowment (HRE), medium resource endowment (MRE), and low resource endowment (LRE). Data on sustainability indicators from cropland, livestock, farm input use, and redistribution units enabled the analysis of biomass and nutrient flow dynamics from households to farmlands and vice versa. The nutrient monitoring (NUTMON) tool generated nutrient flows and balances. Results showed that the total annual biomass collected per hectare by HRE (22.3t) is significantly higher than that collected by MRE (13.4t) and LRE (5.35t) farms (P < 0.001). Compared to LRE (10.3 t ha 1 year 1 ), HRE and MRE farmers produced six times (60 t ha 1 year 1 ) and three times (34 t ha 1 year 1 ) more manure, respectively. Farm households with better endowment status observed a higher rate of nutrient utilization. For the major crops, nutrient application rates of HRE farms in kg ha 1 (cotton: 12.6 N, 4.2 P, 18.2 K) and (maize: 9.18 N, 2.34 P, 10.7 K) were significantly higher than that of MRE and LRE farms (P < 0.01).

Researchers throughout the globe have shown the potential of CA in enriching soil organic carbon storage in various soil types and cropping systems. But there is very limited study on the effect of CA on soil humic acid content and their stability and abundance of functional groups. An experiment was conducted in an Alfisols with four scenarios (designated as Sc) namely conventional farmers practice (Sc1) of transplanted rice (TPR) followed by conventional tilled broadcasted wheat (CT- wheat) with residue removal, transplanted rice (TPR) followed by zero tillage (ZT) wheat and mung bean with partial residue retention (Sc2), direct seeded rice (DSR) followed by ZT- wheat and mung bean with full residue retention (Sc3), ZT-maize followed by ZT-wheat and mung bean (Sc4) at the research farm of ICAR-Central Soil Salinity Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana, India. The objectives of this study were to assess the humic acid (HA) content and stability of soil carbon through desorption study and to characterize the functional groups of HA by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy under different scenarios. HA was extracted from soil samples collected from 0 to 15 and 15–30 cm depth after rice harvesting in 2018 after nine years of the experiment. Results showed that Sc4 recorded significantly highest HA content at 0–15 depth (4.23 g/kg) and 15–30 cm soil depth (2.08 g/kg). Lower E4/E6 ratio revealed higher stability and humification of humic acid carbon under CA based scenarios. Lowest desorption rate constant (0.20/day) was observed under Sc4 indicating higher organic carbon stability in soil. Higher labile carbon and nitrogen was observed in soils under Sc3 as revealed through desorption study. FTIR spectroscopy results confirmed the prevalence of higher number of functional groups (Odouble bondCdouble bondO, Cdouble bondO or CHO) in HA under CA based scenarios with an order of Sc4 >Sc3 >Sc2 >Sc1.

3612,2022,https://reporting.cgiar.org/reports/result-details/3612?phase=1,INIT-10,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Managing salinity for sustainable agricultural production in salt-affected soils of irrigated drylands,"CONTEXT
Declining water quantity and quality and poor land, water, and crop management practices are leading to increasing soil salinity, land degradation, desertification, and threatening the overall sustainability of the crop production system in irrigated drylands. Assessments of salinity dynamics and sustainability indicators under alternative agricultural practices are needed to identify the right combination of practices that improve sustainability while minimizing land and environmental degradation.
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to assess the potential of conservation agriculture (CA)-based practices, water-saving irrigation, water quality, and nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates for improving the sustainability of rice-wheat (RWS) and cotton-wheat (CWS) systems in salt-affected irrigated drylands.
METHODS
The study included mixed-method approaches of two years of field experiments, soil profile and groundwater salinity simulation using Hydrus-1D model, and multi-criteria trade-off analysis for the holistic assessment of alternative innovations in RWS and CWS. The treatments in experiments were composed of a combination of CA-based practices, water-saving irrigation and N rates. Fourteen sustainability indicators computed from experiments and simulation were compared to evaluate the sustainability of those cropping systems and to reveal the potential of those practices for improving sustainability.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Compared to the initial conditions, the soil salinity decreased in both cropping systems, while the reduction rate was much higher in RWS than CWS (by 28%). In RWS, the conventional treatment had the lowest salinity level, while in CWS, CA (permeant bed + residue retention) had the lowest. RWS raised the groundwater table by 25% compared to CWS. The long-term scenario analysis with Hydrus-1D demonstrated that, with increased irrigation water salinity and soil evaporation rates, soil profile salinity increases by 78% in RWS and 66% in CWS. RWS had a higher net profit (+81%) and soil organic carbon (SOC) (-15%), but lower water productivity (WP) (−147%), nitrogen, and energy use efficiency (EUE) (−46%) than CWS. The CA-based practices in CWS improved sustainability indicators with higher yield and net profit (+20%), WP (+26%), SOC (+456%), and EUE (36%) with decreased soil salinity than in the conventional system.",Mohie Omar,(0) Not Targeted,(1) Significant,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,,0,,,,,ICARDA,,,,,," • MANFQ - Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (Netherlands) [Innovation] - Netherlands (Kingdom of the)

However, measurements in developing countries are still scarce. In the Orinoquia region, permanent grasslands (PG; this unimproved, native pasture is considered as at some state of degradation) based on unimproved grasses are found due to extensive, inefficient grazing combined with annual burning of pastures. We hypothesized that, compared to PG, improved grasslands (IG) managed through rotational grazing of introduced, productive and deep-rooted pasture grass species promote soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and reduce N2O emission from urine deposited by grazing cattle. We determined SOC and N2O emissions from urine deposited on soils in an area of PG and in a 6.5 year-old IG area of Urochloa (Syn. Brachiaria) humidicola grass pasture in a beef cattle ranch in Orinoquía region (Colombia). In both areas, we sampled soil for chemical/physical analysis, and measured N2O emissions by simulating urine deposition over 21 days. We applied two-way analysis of variance considering pasture type and soil depth as fixed factors. Estimated SOC stocks (0–100 cm) were in the range of 224.8 Mg C ha−1 for the PG and 259.0 Mg C ha−1 for the IG, with a significant (p < 0.05) average accumulation of 2.0 Mg C ha−1 y−1 (0–20 cm) in the IG area. N2O emissions were 10 times lower in the IG compared to the PG. The introduction of U. humidicola grass influenced SOC accumulation probably through its more abundant root system and greater turnover together with higher (14%) forage dry matter production compared to PG. The reduced N2O emissions observed from urine patches in IG were attributed to biological nitrification inhibition ability and greater nitrogen uptake of U. humidicola grass. Compared to the reference default value of IPCC for, the SOC stock found in PG was almost 40% higher, whereas the N2O emission factor (5%) was within the uncertainty range (0.7–6%). The Orinoquía region shows significant potential for SOC storage and reduced N2O emissions in improved pastures with deep root systems. Thus, scaling the implementation of land-based SOC storage practices/projects could significantly contribute to reducing net emissions from beef production from this region.",Jacobo Arango,(0) Not Targeted,(2) Principal,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,,0,,,,• Hacienda san jose project,CIAT (Alliance),,,"Systems Transformation (5,6)

The present study evaluated the community structure and diversity of FLN in a field setting. The experiments were conducted in on-farm and on-station field plots sown to maize (Zea mays) and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) under four cropping practices. These farming systems included organic (compost and biopesticide use), conventional (synthetic fertilizer and pesticide applications), farmer practice (organic and synthetic amendments) and a control (non-amended plots). Nineteen genera of free living nematodes, belonging to bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores and predators were recorded. Among these, bacterivores (Cephalobidae and Rhabditidae) were the most dominant group in the organic systems when compared to the conventional and control systems. Farming systems influenced the abundance and diversity of free living nematodes, with the organic farming system having higher values of maturity, enrichment and structural indices than other farming systems.

The present study evaluated the community structure and diversity of FLN in a field setting. The experiments were conducted in on-farm and on-station field plots sown to maize (Zea mays) and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) under four cropping practices. These farming systems included organic (compost and biopesticide use), conventional (synthetic fertilizer and pesticide applications), farmer practice (organic and synthetic amendments) and a control (non-amended plots). Nineteen genera of free living nematodes, belonging to bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores and predators were recorded. Among these, bacterivores (Cephalobidae and Rhabditidae) were the most dominant group in the organic systems when compared to the conventional and control systems. Farming systems influenced the abundance and diversity of free living nematodes, with the organic farming system having higher values of maturity, enrichment and structural indices than other farming systems.

The current KPIs cover land productivity and its stability, resource use efficiency and soil health (Table 1; Saito et al., 2021). It is expected that the KPIs will be used across geographies, farming systems, and research and development (R&D) stages to deliver a greater depth of understanding of agronomic gain than has ever been achieved before. This document provides a guideline for measuring agronomic gain KPIs in on-farm trials._x000D_
On-farm trials belong to the proof-of-concept stage, which involves the testing and assessment of improved agronomic practices and their impact on agronomic gain (Fig. 1). These trials are researcher managed, conducted in multiple environments. They compare local, current farmers’ practices or recommended practices (control treatment) with alternative, improved practices that are expected to perform better and are introduced by researchers. These treatments are implemented in the same field, with plots arranged side by side, with the option of replicates within the same field. We will not consider on-farm trials in which improved agronomic practices are piloted or demonstrated in the entire field, without a valid control in the same field._x000D_
Ideally, all KPIs should be collected in all trials. However, early in the proof-of-concept stage (e.g. first year of testing), the final decision on which indicators will be collected at each site will be decided by the researchers, usually depending on available resources. Later, when improved agronomic practices are evaluated for their suitability to be moved to the next stage — specifically when moving from the ‘proof-of-concept’ or the ‘pilot’ to ‘scaling’ stages — the decision-making should be based on data on all indicators (Fig. 1). Only the full set of indicator data (yield, its stability, profitability, labor and capital demand, soil health, climate change adaptation etc.) will enable comprehensive estimation of agronomic gains of improved agronomic practices and prevent individual aspects or features of the improved practices hampering adoption._x000D_

Addressing the vulnerability of local communities (i.e., refugees, IDPs, and host communities in this study) to natural hazards, such as drought and floods as well as environmental (soil, vegetation) degradation, requires humanitarian and development strategies to reconcile life-saving objectives and environmental safeguarding. With this consideration, implementing nature-based solutions (NbS) could be one option to balance the objectives of life-saving and environmental management activities.

Therefore, the present study was conducted in the Dolo Ado and Bokolmayo districts, Somali Region, Ethiopia to: (i) identify NbS to address the vulnerability of refugees, IDPs, and host communities to natural hazards, and (ii) map potential areas for implementing the interventions. It used multiple methods, such as an inception workshop, reconnaissance surveys, focus group discussions (FGDs), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and remote sensing techniques to collect and analyze data. In addition, it used two frameworks — the IUCN Global Standard for NbS and the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) — to identify, design, and verify NbS.

The results suggest that the study area experienced significant landscape alteration in the last 15 years. Specifically, the increase in farmlands at the expense of forestland, grasslands, and shrublands reflects an evolving agricultural landscape that demands attention to sustainable practices. It is also detected that a considerable proportion (28%) of the land area is degraded, suggesting the need for targeted interventions, especially in grasslands and bare lands, to mitigate or at least reduce degradation risks and natural hazards such as drought and floods.

This study identified several context-specific NbS options, which can be classified as water harvesting measures, ecological restoration measures, agroforestry practices, and buffer zone management practices. The NbS vary in cost, trajectory, and specific economic and social outcomes. Most of the NbS were found to be economically viable, environmentally friendly, and socially acceptable. Existing favorable policies and frameworks, active participation of stakeholders in humanitarian and resilience-building activities, enormous government interest, and the possibilities of establishing early warning systems in refugees, IDPs, and host communities can be considered as opportunities for wider implementation of NbS. We offered key recommendations for future actions in the areas of coordination and active participation of stakeholders, capacity building and learning, natural resources management, empowerment of local communities, enforcement of existing policies, the use of adaptive management tools and approaches, and financing mechanisms of NbS.

Regions blessed with abundant natural resources, encompassing fertile soils, lush forests, freshwater bodies, valuable minerals, and more, tend to experience rapid population growth and heightened poverty rates. This often results in a heightened demand for essential livelihood components, including access to alternative livelihoods, education, food, healthcare, water, forest resources, housing, roads, and spaces for agriculture and aquaculture. Furthermore, the intersection of multiple national and global stakeholders continues to exert substantial pressure on exploiting natural resources at the sub-national level. To address the pervasive issue of land degradation, particularly in developing nations like Burundi, the implementation of landscape surveying and mapping emerges as a crucial tool. These methods provide valuable insights into ecosystem services and their interactions, paving the way for sustainable landscape conservation.
Employing the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) for Social-Ecological Landscape (SEL) assessment framework, a diverse array of methodologies was employed in the current study, with a focus on the sub-Nyamagana watershed on the Imbo plain in Burundi. This research aims to conduct a comprehensive situational analysis, shedding light on how drivers and pressures converge to define the state and impacts of SEL, while also emphasizing institutional and stakeholder responses. To delve deeper into the intricacies of the Nyamagana watershed, a complementary approach involving focus group discussions and individual questionnaires was undertaken. The survey covered a total of 166 households and six focus group discussions, each comprising twelve participants. The findings highlighted several factors and pressures, predominantly stemming from the intensive utilization of natural resources, as well as biotic and abiotic constraints such as drought, flooding, pests, diseases, and anthropogenic pressures like anarchic mining and rapid population growth. Of notable concern is the complexity of soil use and land cover, especially the widespread use of chemicals such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, which pose significant threats to ecosystem components. The social-ecological dynamics are characterized by a combination of ecological factors, including environmental disturbances like heavy rains, prolonged dry seasons, fires, deforestation, and climate change.

However, they are a crucial part of soil biodiversity. Due to the limited data available regarding nematode biodiversity associated with cereal crops in Morocco, a survey was conducted in 2019 across 80 wheat fields. Thirty-three nematode taxa were obtained with different trophic groups: 11 bacterivores (i.e., Rhabditis and Cephalobus spp.), 11 herbivores (i.e., Pratylenchus and Heterodera spp.), 6 fungivores (i.e., Ditylenchus and Aphelenchoides spp.), 4 omnivores (i.e., Dorylaimus and Aporcelaimus spp.) and one predator (Mononchus spp.). For each locality, the diversity of nematode communities was assessed through multiple diversity indices. Three areas (Ait Melloul, Oulad Dahou, and Sidi Boushab) were more diversified and had pronounced nematode occurrence. Moreover, few localities (e.g., Ait Amira and Lqliaa) were shown to be disturbed. Our study underlined that several nematode taxa were significantly correlated with edaphic and climatic/geographic properties.

This study used a before and after soil and water conservation practices (SWCP) comparison approach to evaluate the effect of SWCP on soil quality dynamics. Fifty-four composite and 10 undisturbed soil samples were collected in 2012 (before SWCP) and 2022 (after SWCP). Statistical mean, analysis of variance, and principal component analysis were applied to test the significant differences among treatments. The findings demonstrated that SWCP has significantly improved most of the soil quality indicators such as soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorous, pH, total porosity, field capacity, and available water, and reduced the value of bulk density and coarse fragments. The interaction effect of landscape position and types of structures provided statistically significant results for soil organic matter, total nitrogen, magnesium, calcium, and base saturation. Soil and stone-faced soil bunds treated at lower landscapes were superior in improving soil quality attributes. The soil quality indexing showed, the overall soil quality improvement as a result of SWCP was about 32.15%. The level of improvement for different SWCPs was 32% for stone faced soil bunds and 33% for soil bunds. The findings revealed that SWCP implementation can improve soil quality.

Facing these risks is the most important issue for sustainable development. Conventional tillage (CT) practices seem to expose the soils of semi-arid regions, which are initially fragile, to degradation that is accentuated by the overuse of the environment. The benefits of conservation agriculture (CA) could mitigate the degradation of natural resources, particularly soils. The adaptation and transfer of the no-till (NT) system with mulch open new perspectives for the development of agriculture in semi-arid regions. The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of conservation agriculture, especially no-till (NT) system, on the physical properties of soil (structural stability (SS), bulk density (BD), gravimetric water content (θg), and soil organic matter (SOM)) compared to conventional tillage (CT). The main changes associated with the transition from a CT system to an NT system were evaluated at the experimental site, Merchouch (M13), which is typified by vertisol soil, and at the Ain Sbit (AS7) site, which is characterized by isohumic soil. Under a no-till system, most of the physical properties of the soil were improved in both sites, with a clear difference in the M13 site. Structural stability under NT showed a significant increase in both sites (fast wetting (FW), slow wetting (SW), and wet stirring (WS) improved by 88, 43, and 83% at the M13 site, respectively, against, 16, 23, and 7%, respectively, at the AS7 site). On the other hand, the SOM increased from 2.0 to 2.6% (an improvement of 28%) at AS7 and from 1.2% to 1.9% (an improvement of 52%) at M13. This research demonstrated that conservation agriculture, especially NT, improves the soil physical quality in both medium and long terms, confirming its suitability for the climatic and edaphic constraints of semi-arid areas in Morocco as well as in other parts of the world.",Rachid Moussadek; R.Moussadek@cgiar.org,(0) Not Targeted,(1) Significant,(0) Not Targeted,(2) Principal,(0) Not Targeted,,0,,,INIT-10,,,ICARDA,,"Systems Transformation (1,5,6)

Facing these risks is the most important issue for sustainable development. Conventional tillage (CT) practices seem to expose the soils of semi-arid regions, which are initially fragile, to degradation that is accentuated by the overuse of the environment. The benefits of conservation agriculture (CA) could mitigate the degradation of natural resources, particularly soils. The adaptation and transfer of the no-till (NT) system with mulch open new perspectives for the development of agriculture in semi-arid regions. The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of conservation agriculture, especially no-till (NT) system, on the physical properties of soil (structural stability (SS), bulk density (BD), gravimetric water content (θg), and soil organic matter (SOM)) compared to conventional tillage (CT). The main changes associated with the transition from a CT system to an NT system were evaluated at the experimental site, Merchouch (M13), which is typified by vertisol soil, and at the Ain Sbit (AS7) site, which is characterized by isohumic soil. Under a no-till system, most of the physical properties of the soil were improved in both sites, with a clear difference in the M13 site. Structural stability under NT showed a significant increase in both sites (fast wetting (FW), slow wetting (SW), and wet stirring (WS) improved by 88, 43, and 83% at the M13 site, respectively, against, 16, 23, and 7%, respectively, at the AS7 site). On the other hand, the SOM increased from 2.0 to 2.6% (an improvement of 28%) at AS7 and from 1.2% to 1.9% (an improvement of 52%) at M13. This research demonstrated that conservation agriculture, especially NT, improves the soil physical quality in both medium and long terms, confirming its suitability for the climatic and edaphic constraints of semi-arid areas in Morocco as well as in other parts of the world.",gpt-4.1,"Yes, the text discusses aspects that directly relate to soil health, specifically the effects of tillage systems on soil physical properties and quality.",1

While CA is a well-established approach, research results are lacking regarding its long-term impact on nitrogen (N) dynamics in the soil–plant system. In this study, a 20-year experiment was used to investigate the long-term effects of no-tillage in CA on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) mineralization, plant N uptake, grain yields, and the grain quality of durum wheat. A CA system based on no-tillage (NT) was evaluated and compared with conventional tillage (CT) used for wheat/legumes biennial crop rotation. Results showed that soil samples from CA plots experienced significantly more N mineralization than those under CT, which was attributed to increased SOC and N. Topsoil sampled from the CA plots 20 years after the implementation of the experiment had 43% more absolute potentially mineralizable N (N0) than the CT plots, with no significant differences observed in deeper soil layers (15–30 cm and 30–45 cm). The absolute potentially mineralizable carbon (C0) in soils from the CA system was 49% and 35% higher than in soils from the CT system, at soil depths of 0–15 and 15–30 cm, respectively. Furthermore, CA resulted in higher amounts of remobilized N and higher rates of N uptake during the critical growth stages of durum wheat. The amount of N remobilized during the kernel-filling phase under CA was 59% higher than under CT. Total N uptake in wheat plants was 45% greater under CA compared to CT. The most significant differences in N uptake between the CA and CT systems were observed during two critical growth stages: late tillering to heading (1.7 times higher in CA than CT) and heading to anthesis (1.5 times higher in CA than CT). The most significant differences for N uptake were shown during the late tillering to heading stage and the heading to anthesis stage. The amount of N remobilized during the kernel filling phase under CA was 59% higher than CT. CA adoption resulted in 21% and 35% higher grain and straw yields, respectively, compared to CT. The grain and straw N yields were 21% and 51% higher, respectively, under CA than CT. Moreover, the CA system exhibited higher partial factor productivity of nitrogen fertilizer (PFP N) for both grain and straw yields. Thousand kernel weight (TKW) and hectoliter weight were also significantly higher under CA than CT. The grain protein content, wet gluten content, vitreousness, and falling number were similar between the CA and CT systems. These results highlight the benefits of long-term CA adoption to increase soil N mineralization, providing a substantial base for N uptake during the critical growth stages of durum wheat, thus leading to increased crop yield.

The soil types were abruptic Lixisols at Domboshava Training Centre (DTC) and xanthic Ferralsol at the University of Zimbabwe farm (UZF). The following six treatments, which were replicated four times, were investigated: conventional tillage (CT), conventional tillage with rotation (CTR), no tillage (NT), no tillage with mulch (NTM), no tillage with rotation (NTR), and no tillage with mulch and rotation (NTMR). Maize (Zea mays L.) was the main crop, and treatments with rotation included cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.).

and nitrogen fertilization on soil fertility and the yield of five durum wheat varieties developed in
Morocco in a long-term (18 years) NT trial at the INRA Merchouch experimental station, Morocco.
The results show that tillage type had a significant effect on soil organic carbon and CEC (measured
before the start of the experiment), as well as on ammonium and nitrates (measured at the end of the
experiment), whereas nitrogen dose had a significant effect on total nitrogen and nitrates (measured
at the end of the experiment). Regarding wheat yield, as measured at the end of the experiment

This study modeled SOC variables—SOC, refractory SOC (RSOC), and the 13C isotope composition of SOC (δ13CSOC)—using machine learning (ML) algorithms in the Central Andean Highlands of Peru, where grasslands and wetlands (“bofedales”) dominate the landscape surrounded by Junin National Reserve. A total of 198 soil samples (0.3 m depth) were collected to assess SOC variables. Four ML algorithms—random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB)—were used to model SOC variables using remote sensing data, land-use and land-cover (LULC, nine categories), climate topography, and sampled physical–chemical soil variables. RF was the best algorithm for SOC and δ13CSOC prediction, whereas ANN was the best to model RSOC. “Bofedales” showed 2–3 times greater SOC (11.2 ± 1.60%) and RSOC (1.10 ± 0.23%) and more depleted δ13CSOC (− 27.0 ± 0.44 ‰) than other LULC, which reflects high C persistent, turnover rates, and plant productivity.

This study modeled SOC variables—SOC, refractory SOC (RSOC), and the 13C isotope composition of SOC (δ13CSOC)—using machine learning (ML) algorithms in the Central Andean Highlands of Peru, where grasslands and wetlands (“bofedales”) dominate the landscape surrounded by Junin National Reserve. A total of 198 soil samples (0.3 m depth) were collected to assess SOC variables. Four ML algorithms—random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB)—were used to model SOC variables using remote sensing data, land-use and land-cover (LULC, nine categories), climate topography, and sampled physical–chemical soil variables. RF was the best algorithm for SOC and δ13CSOC prediction, whereas ANN was the best to model RSOC. “Bofedales” showed 2–3 times greater SOC (11.2 ± 1.60%) and RSOC (1.10 ± 0.23%) and more depleted δ13CSOC (− 27.0 ± 0.44 ‰) than other LULC, which reflects high C persistent, turnover rates, and plant productivity.

This study investigated the effects of land-use on soil aggregation and associated carbon stocks. A total of 200 soil samples were collected across five land-use, comprising rubber (RP) and oil palm plantations (OPP), bamboo forests (BF), fallow land (FL), and natural forest (NF). A comprehensive land-use intensity index, encompassing six key dimensions of land-use change, was integrated into robust regression models. The soil analyses revealed that macroaggregates dominated the top 15 cm (51–64 %), followed by meso- (30–39 %) and microaggregates (6–12 %). At deeper depths (15–30 cm), mesoaggregates prevailed (45.3–52.1 %). NF and BF exhibited the highest microaggregate fractions, resulting in lower mean weight diameter (MWD) and potentially lower aggregate stability. In contrast, RP and OPP displayed the highest macroaggregate distribution and MWD. Soil organic carbon generally decreased with land-use change from NF to FL and plantations, except for RP. MWD significantly correlated with silt and clay content, while meso- and micro-aggregates correlated with silt/clay content, MWD, and nitrogen (N).

In this study, we quantify the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) content and stocks in the Casanare flooded savannas. We sampled 80 sites at two soil-depth intervals (0-10 and 10-30 cm), where SOC values ranged from 0.41% in the surface and 0.23% in the sub-surface of drier soils to over 14.50% and 7.51%, in soils that experienced seasonal flooding. Spatial predictions of SOC were done through two digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches: Expert-Knowledge (EK) and Random-Forest (RF). Although both approaches performed well, EK was slightly superior at predicting SOC. Covariates derived from vegetation cover, topography, and soil properties were identified as key drivers in controlling its distribution. Total SOC stocks were 55.07 Mt with a mean density of 83.1±24.3 t·ha -1 in the first 30 cm of soil, with 12.3% of this located in areas that experience long periods of flooding (semi-seasonal savannas) , which represented only 7.9% of the study area (664,752 ha).

In this study, we quantify the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) content and stocks in the Casanare flooded savannas. We sampled 80 sites at two soil-depth intervals (0-10 and 10-30 cm), where SOC values ranged from 0.41% in the surface and 0.23% in the sub-surface of drier soils to over 14.50% and 7.51%, in soils that experienced seasonal flooding. Spatial predictions of SOC were done through two digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches: Expert-Knowledge (EK) and Random-Forest (RF). Although both approaches performed well, EK was slightly superior at predicting SOC. Covariates derived from vegetation cover, topography, and soil properties were identified as key drivers in controlling its distribution. Total SOC stocks were 55.07 Mt with a mean density of 83.1±24.3 t·ha -1 in the first 30 cm of soil, with 12.3% of this located in areas that experience long periods of flooding (semi-seasonal savannas) , which represented only 7.9% of the study area (664,752 ha). Although the study area represents only 15% of the total area of the Casanare department, the intensive pressure of human development could result in the reduction of its SOC stocks and the release of important amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

as environmental and food safety. Due to the lack of relevant data sources and methodologies,
analyzing SOC dynamics has been a challenge in Morocco. During the last two decades, processbased
models have been adopted as alternative and powerful tools for modeling SOC dynamics;
whereas, information and knowledge on the most sensitive model inputs under different climate,
and soil conditions are still very limited. For this purpose, a sensitivity analysis was conducted
in the present work, using the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model based on the data
collected at a semi-arid region (Merchouch station, Morocco). The objective is to identify the most
influential factors affecting the DNDC-modeled SOC dynamics in a semi-arid region across different
climatic and soil conditions. The results of sensitivity analysis highlighted air temperature as the main
determinant of SOC. A decrease in air temperature of 4  C results in an almost 161 kg C ha?1 yr?1
increase in C sequestration rate. Initial SOC was also confirmed to be one of the most sensitive
parameters for SOC. There was a 96 kg C ha?1 yr?1 increase in C sequestration rate under low initial
SOC (0.005 kg C ha?1). In the DNDC, air temperature in climatic factors and initial SOC in variable
soil properties had the largest impacts on SOC accumulation in Merchouch station. We can conclude
that the sensitivity analysis conducted in this study within the DNDC can contribute to provide a
scientific evidence of uncertainties of the selected inputs variables who can lead to uncertainties

Recently, conservation agriculture practices such as minimum tillage, crop rotation, soil surface cover, intercropping, and planting in basins alongside trees that enhance soil fertility, have been introduced in Zambia as tools to conserve soil moisture, increase peanut yield, and reduce the risk of aflatoxin contamination. However, a limited understanding exists of the impact of conservation agriculture on Aspergillus population densities in the soil and aflatoxin concentrations in crops grown under conservation agriculture. This study assessed the impact of conservation agriculture on (i) Aspergillus communities profile in soil cropped to peanuts, (ii) peanut aflatoxin contamination levels, and (iii) influences of the practices on liver cancer risks as a result of consuming peanuts grown in basins, peanuts grown in basins in farms having Gliricidia sepium trees (agroforestry), and peanuts grown on ridges (conventional tillage). Densities of Aspergillus spp. in soils ranged from 10 to 7,400 CFU/g (mean = 295 CFU/g). The densities differed among farming techniques (p = 0.0011) with conventional tillage (357 CFU/g) supporting higher densities than agroforestry (296 CFU/g) and peanuts grown in basins (230 CFU/g). Aspergillus communities were dominated by fungi with S morphology (55%; which is composed of several morphologically similar species), followed by A. parasiticus (34%), and the L morphotype of A. flavus (11%). Over 60% of the peanut samples were contaminated but there were no differences among farming techniques. Mean aflatoxin contents in peanuts were 110, 99, and 87, μg/kg for agroforestry, conventional tillage, and peanuts grown in basins, respectively. Probable daily aflatoxin intake ranged from 12.7 to 767.1 ng/kg body weight/d, depending on the age of consumers. The estimated liver cancer risk due to consumption of raw peanuts (0.334 to 20.128 cases/100,000 persons/year) was highest among children below 5 years and least for young adults. The results showed that growing peanuts in basins has the potential to reduce Aspergillus populations in soil. Possibly, planting in basins and agroforestry had minimal effect on water runoff and did not support sufficient moisture retention in the soil to reduce Aspergillus spp. densities and aflatoxin accumulation in the peanuts. Thus, more research is needed to improve the effectiveness of peanut cultivation in basins in shaping the Aspergillus species profiles for ultimately reducing aflatoxin in peanuts to safe levels. Given the high exposure of Zambia’s population, especially children, and that contaminated food is the major source of exposure, it is essential that appropriate technical, policy and institutional measures are promoted for aflatoxin mitigation in Zambia.",Alejandro Ortega-Beltran,(0) Not Targeted,(1) Significant,(1) Significant,(1) Significant,(1) Significant,,0,,,,,,IITA,,,,Goal 15: Life on Land (15.8),Marked as not applicable,Zambia,East and Southern Africa,,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/141731,,,,,,RAFS,0.4236225187778473,"Impact of conservation farming practices on Aspergillus population density, peanut aflatoxin level, and exposure risk in Zambia Aflatoxin contamination in peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) by aflatoxin-producing Aspergillus spp. is a serious problem worldwide affecting human health and restricting trade.

Atriplex species demonstrated higher suitability indexes. While leguminous species enhanced soil nutrient status, their low initial biomass productivity limited suitability for livestock forage. Opuntia ficus-indica, with a lower suitability index, was deemed unsuitable for direct browsing, as it was primarily a cut-and-carry crop.

It assessed their suitability based on forage production, quality, direct browsing, seasonal suitability for direct browsing and soil fertility. Atriplex species demonstrated higher suitability indexes. While leguminous species enhanced soil nutrient status, their low initial biomass productivity limited suitability for livestock forage. Opuntia ficus-indica, with a lower suitability index, was deemed unsuitable for direct browsing, as it was primarily a cut-and-carry crop. Therefore, the successful implementation of alley cropping systems requires a careful balance and analysis of shrub species that not only provide ample forage biomass support but also direct browsing and contribute to enhanced soil conditions for crop growth.

Its purposes are to encourage the adoption and innovation of sustainable intensification technologies that improve crop, livestock, and water productivity, and conserve natural resources for smallholder farmers in Ethiopia.  To implement the SI-MFS in Ethiopia, three project sites in Basona Worena (of North Shewa Zone of Amhara region), Doyogena (Kembata Timber Zone of SNNP), and Lemmo Woreda (Hadiya Zone of SNNP) were selected based on bio-physical and socio-economic criteria set by experts of the implementing CG centres (i.e., ABC, ILRI, and ICARDA) based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The objective of this study was to characterize the biophysical features of the project woredas and produce primary benchmark information to establish key monitorable biophysical indicators. This study encompassed topographic characterization, climate, existing land use and land cover, soil chemical and physical properties, soil erosion, land net productivity, and carbon storage of the selected sites.
Accordingly, the study sites were found to have mountainous, undulating terrain that is prone to soil erosion. Because of the extensive range in elevation, the study areas have diverse vegetation and broad farming systems. Thus, it is quite common to see different types of cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits, and agro-forestry practices throughout the study sites. The slop map has revealed that the majority of the area in Basona woreda is represented by slopes greater than 15%, making this site quite challenging for agricultural uses. As a result, there is a need to introduce various soil and water conservation measures to improve the farmland and sustain crop production. Conversely, a significant portion of Lemmo and Doyogena Woreda has slopes that are either almost flat or gentle sloping, making the two sites more ideal for agriculture. The long-term mean rainfall analysis has indicated that Basona woreda receives rainfall ranging from 890 to 1310.38 mm, whilst Lemo and Doyogena Woreda receive rainfall ranging from 1114.98 to 1273.56mm and 1163 to 1311.58mm, respectively. More than 70% of the annual rainfall in the study woredas are received during the main rainfall season (referred to as Kiremt) that occurs between June to September. 
Agricultural land is found to be the most dominant LULC type in the Basona Worena woreda. In Doyogena and Lemo Woredas, the most common LULC types are forest land and bareland, respectively. In general, soil in the study site was found to be predominantly acidic, with organic carbon and nitrogen contents ranging from 1 to 36 g/kg and 1 to 4 g/kg, respectively. Clay and clay loam textured soil is the major soil texture class in the study woredas, and these classes of soils are often very fertile and could be used for agricultural uses. Vertisols, a highly productive group of soils, are the dominant soil type in Baona woreda and covers more than half of the total area. While Luvisols are the most common soil type in both Lemo and Doyogena Woreda. Luvisols are generally fertile and widely used in agriculture.

METHODS_x000D_
We used data collected from 1406 plots between 2013 and 2020 in semi-arid and sub-humid AEZs. The data are from farmer practices. The plots were grouped by the various combinations of ISFM components implemented and analysed using Tukey's test to examine the association of ISFM use with selected indicators within a domain._x000D_
_x000D_
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS_x000D_
The number of ISFM components used by farmers is higher in sub-humid (1 to 4) than in semi-arid AEZ (0 to 3). Except for SWC used by 40% of farmers in both AEZs, the proportion of farmers using improved seeds (95%) and manure (55%) in the sub-humid AEZ are more than double those using these ISFM components in the semi-arid AEZ. Productivity and economic benefits increase with the number of ISFM components at the expense of higher labour demand. Increasing plot-level ISFM benefits also translate to increased household-level whole-farm income but contributions to human nutrition are unclear. The contribution to SOC by increasing ISFM is insignificant, compounded by strong effects of slope position of the field. Differential access to resources, decision-making and control rights drive the number and choice of the specific ISFM components._x000D_

Yet, the challenges of crop residue availability for mulch or the difficulties in managing weed proliferation in CA systems are bigger than a micro-level focus on weeds and crop residues themselves. The bottlenecks are symptoms of broader systemic complications that cannot be resolved without appreciating the interactions between the current scientific understanding of CA and its application in smallholder systems, private incentives, social norms, institutions, and government policy. In this paper, we elucidate a series of areas that represent some unquestioned answers about chemical weed control and unanswered questions about how to maintain groundcover demanding more research along the natural and social sciences continuum. In some communities, traditional rules that allow free-range grazing of livestock after harvesting present a barrier in surface crop residue management. On the other hand, many of the communities either burn, remove, or incorporate the residues into the soil thus hindering the near-permanent soil cover required in CA systems. The lack of soil cover also means that weed management through soil mulch is unachievable. Herbicides are often a successful stopgap solution to weed control, but they are costly, and most farmers do not use them as recommended, which reduces efficacy. Besides, the use of herbicides can cause environmental hazards and may affect human health. Here, we suggest further assessment of the manipulation of crop competition, the use of vigorously growing cover crops, exploration of allelopathy, and use of microorganisms in managing weeds and reducing seed production to deplete the soil weed seed bank. We also suggest in situ production of plant biomass, use of unpalatable species for mulch generation and change of grazing by-laws towards a holistic management of pastures to reduce the competition for crop residues.

While upwards of 70% of Zimbabwe’s population works in agriculture, the sector generates only 17% of GDP (FAO, 2023). Livestock production contributes an additional 35% of GDP and is equally common, with 60% of the population owning cattle and 70-90% owning goats. Zimbabwe experiences a single rainy season that historically runs from November to March. Rainfall is limited and erratic, and peasant farmers have access to under 5% of national irrigation facilities (FAO, 2023). Soils in Zimbabwe are highly sandy and low-fertility granitic soils, contributing to water management challenges under changing climatic conditions. Many smallholder farmers use inorganic fertilizers, but at rates lower than typically recommended, and manure is widely used among livestock owners (Zingore et al., 2011). Zimbabwe has a burgeoning youth population, with 42% of its 12 million inhabitants under 15 (FAO, 2023). These conditions, combined with political uncertainty and currency instability, contribute to widespread food insecurity and malnutrition; 38% of the population suffered undernourishment between 2020-2022, and 29% was severely food insecure (FAOSTAT, 2023). Over 90% of children aged 6-24 months do not consume the minimum acceptable diet (FAO, 2023), and 22% of children under 5 are stunted (FAOSTAT, 2023). Although Zimbabwe is reasonably well forested (40% of land area), it has Africa’s third-highest rate of deforestation and has lost an estimated 6 million ha of forests in the last twenty years (FAO, 2023). Many regions boast high levels of biodiversity and an abundance of wildlife, including tourist-attracting megafauna that, while revenue-generating, often contribute to human-wildlife conflict and heightened tensions between agro-pastoralists and conservation efforts (Baudron et al., 2022). These conditions underscore the potential of agroecological transformation to improve livelihoods, boost economic productivity, conserve natural resources, and support food security and nutrition. In Zimbabwe, the CGIAR Agroecology Initiative (AE-I) supports the transition to more environmentally sustainable, productive, and socially just agri-food systems.

While upwards of 70% of Zimbabwe’s population works in agriculture, the sector generates only 17% of GDP (FAO, 2023). Livestock production contributes an additional 35% of GDP and is equally common, with 60% of the population owning cattle and 70-90% owning goats. Zimbabwe experiences a single rainy season that historically runs from November to March. Rainfall is limited and erratic, and peasant farmers have access to under 5% of national irrigation facilities (FAO, 2023). Soils in Zimbabwe are highly sandy and low-fertility granitic soils, contributing to water management challenges under changing climatic conditions. Many smallholder farmers use inorganic fertilizers, but at rates lower than typically recommended, and manure is widely used among livestock owners (Zingore et al., 2011).

Combined use of mineral fertilizers, organic inputs, improved germplasm and adaptation of these practices to local contexts through improved agronomy can promote efficiency whilst building stocks of soil organic matter (SOM). Within this framework, recent attention has turned to the nature of plant-soil interactions to increase response to mineral fertilizer inputs through utilisation of nutrients from SOM that are replenished through management. This utilisation has been shown in barley and maize to vary with genotype and to be related to root physiological traits associated with rhizodeposition. The identification of candidate genes associated with rhizodeposition takes this a step closer towards the possibility of breeding for sustainability. Here we discuss this potential and feasibility in the context of maize cropping systems, and explore the potential for a combined approach that optimises utilisation of SOM nutrients together with enhanced biological nitrification inhibition to further improve agronomic efficiency.",Blessing Mhlanga,(0) Not Targeted,(1) Significant,(1) Significant,(1) Significant,(0) Not Targeted,,0,,,INIT-01,,CIMMYT,,,"Systems Transformation (1,2)

Combined use of mineral fertilizers, organic inputs, improved germplasm and adaptation of these practices to local contexts through improved agronomy can promote efficiency whilst building stocks of soil organic matter (SOM). Within this framework, recent attention has turned to the nature of plant-soil interactions to increase response to mineral fertilizer inputs through utilisation of nutrients from SOM that are replenished through management. This utilisation has been shown in barley and maize to vary with genotype and to be related to root physiological traits associated with rhizodeposition. The identification of candidate genes associated with rhizodeposition takes this a step closer towards the possibility of breeding for sustainability. Here we discuss this potential and feasibility in the context of maize cropping systems, and explore the potential for a combined approach that optimises utilisation of SOM nutrients together with enhanced biological nitrification inhibition to further improve agronomic efficiency.",gpt-4.1,"Yes, the text discusses aspects that relate directly to soil health, such as soil organic matter (SOM), soil degradation, plant-soil interactions, and management practices that build or utilize SOM.",4

Tully or Humidicola is one of the most widely planted tropical forage grasses for improving livestock productivity. Low nutritional quality of this grass limits sustainable livestock production in this region. In this study, we conducted a phenotypic evaluation under field and greenhouse conditions of one of the first hybrid populations of U. humidicola generated from the forage breeding program of CIAT. Our objective was to identify a set of new hybrids of U. humidicola that combine improved productivity and nutritional quality plus the biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) trait/ability to reduce nitrogen (N) losses via leaching and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. To this end, we tested 118 hybrids (planted in pots) in the greenhouse for over 6 months and measured potential nitrification rates (NR) using soil microcosm incubation. NR values observed ranged from 0.27 to 5.75 mg N-NO3− kg soil−1 day−1. Later, 12 hybrids with different levels of NR were selected and field-tested in the Orinoquia region over a 4 years period (2013–2017) for dry matter production, nutrition quality (crude protein, in vitro digestibility and fibres content) and NR in each year. In the rainy season of 2018, two hybrids with superior agronomic performance and contrasting field level NR (Uh08/1149 and 0450) were subjected to analysis of soil-borne N2O emissions after fertilization during 13 days.

Soil salinization is a significant environmental challenge prevalent in arid and semi-arid regions, causing adverse effects on crop yields and jeopardizing household food security. Previous research has examined the influence of institutional dynamics and the adoption of sustainable land management practices in bolstering agricultural output, and some have investigated the interplay among socioeconomic determinants, institutional frameworks, and the uptake of climate-resilient and sustainable methodologies, or the association between soil health and agricultural productivity. Yet, there has been a lack of studies that considered this relationship altogether and their role in enhancing soil fertility.

OBJECTIVE
We investigate the relationship among socioeconomic and institutional factors, adoption of sustainable land management practices, and the resulting changes in soil fertility between 2016 and 2019 within the context of mixed crop-livestock farms in the three irrigated agroecological zones of Punjab, Pakistan. A household survey was conducted in 2019 to complement soil attributes data collected by the Government of Punjab in 2016. Households that implemented sustainable land management practices between 2016 and 2019 were analysed to investigate the effect of various factors on soil fertility, including the adoption of sustainable land management practices and their influence on soil fertility dynamics.

METHODS
A structural equation model was employed to examine the relationship among exogenous variables, moderating variables, and endogenous variables, to explain their collective influence on soil fertility between the two periods.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The key findings highlight the significant role of institutional factors, including access to formal information channels such as extension services, demonstration trials, and credit facilities, alongside secure land rights, in predicting the adoption of sustainable land management practices such as gypsum application, laser land leveling, farmyard manuring, and agroforestry. Furthermore, specific SLM practices, particularly agroforestry featuring intercropping with Acacia spp. and farmyard manure application, exhibited positive impacts on change in soil organic matter, albeit with agroforestry showing a negative influence on soil phosphorus levels. The adoption of gypsum and LLL displayed positive effects on soil phosphorus levels over time, contrasting with LLL's adverse impact on soil organic matter.

SIGNIFICANCE
Our findings suggest that soil fertility benefits from policies enacted through public-private partnerships that lead to improved access to sustainable land management information, reduced credit barriers, establishment of local soil testing facilities, and expedited land entitlement processes. These findings highlight the critical role of collaborative partnerships and institutional arrangements in enhancing agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability.","Steve Davies, Mohsin Hafeez",(0) Not Targeted,(1) Significant,(0) Not Targeted,(2) Principal,(1) Significant,,0,,,,,,IFPRI,,,,"Goal 2: Zero Hunger (2.2,2.3,2.4)

However, intensive conventional tillage-based practices have harmed soil and environmental health, decreased productivity trends and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Objective: This study aims to develop resilient, climate-smart cropping systems within the RW system, focusing on soil and crop productivity, economic viability, and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Methods: Over eight years, the study evaluated diverse parameters compared to farmer practices (FP) in seven scenarios (Sc), including one representing FP (Sc1) and six based on conservation agriculture (CA) principles. The study assessed system crop productivity, economic returns, soil quality (organic carbon; OC, nitrogen; N, phosphorus; P, potassium; K contents, bulk density; BD, soil aggregation, infiltration rates, microbial counts, and earthworm density), and GHG emissions. Results: CA-based scenarios (Sc2 to Sc7) showed improved soil quality, lower bulk density, enhanced soil aggregation, and increased infiltration rates compared to Sc1. In the 0–15 cm layer, surface soil organic carbon (OC) and C stock were 63.7 % and 49.6 % higher, respectively, in CA-based scenarios. Additionally, available N, P and K contents in the surface layer increased by 10.2 %, 28.6 %, and 21.8 % under CA-based scenarios. Adoption of CA in intensified maize-based scenarios (Sc4 and Sc5) led to the increased system and economic yields, higher soil quality index (SQI), reduced GHG emissions and increased C stock compared to Sc1.

The influence of climate-smart agriculture (CSA)-based sustainable intensification practices (zero tillage, crop rotations, crop residue retention, and precision water and nutrients application) on earthworms’ (EWs) populations and soil physico-biochemical properties of rice-wheat cropping system in the Indo-Gangetic plains of South Asia was investigated. This study investigates the effect of 10-years adoption of various CSA practices on the abundance of earthworms and physical and biochemical properties of the soil and EWs’ casts (EWC). Five scenarios (Sc) were included: conventionally managed rice-wheat system (farmers’ practices, Sc1), CSA-based rice-wheat-mungbean system with flood irrigation (FI) (Sc2) and subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) (Sc3), CSA-based maize-wheat-mungbean system with FI (Sc4), and SDI (Sc5).

Here we report a comprehensive evaluation of the capacity of APSIM for simulating the performance of CA and CT cropping practices under a diverse range of tillage (CT vs zero tillage (ZT)), crop establishment options (puddled transplanted rice vs unpuddled transplanted rice), residue, N rates, and irrigation practices from two sites in the EGP that differed in soil type, water table dynamics, and agro-climatic conditions. We followed a robust procedure of model parameterisation, calibration, and validation, then undertook statistical analyses to evaluate model performance. We have demonstrated that when different values for key model input parameters are employed (i.e. change in soil properties (Ks, BD)), crop rooting parameters (xf- root hospitality, kl- root extraction efficiency) and soil microorganism activity (Fbiom- fraction of soil organic matter present as microbial biomass and Finert- the inert fraction of soil organic matter), the model performed well in simulating the different performances of CA and CT management practices across the environments in the EGP. Model performance was markedly better in the full-N than in zero-N, but both are still considered acceptable. In addition to well-watered and fertilised treatments, the model was able to capture an observed crop failure in rainfed unpuddled transplanted rice accurately, illustrating an ability to capture crop response under a wide range of water stress environments. As demonstrated by robust statistical criteria, APSIM was able to capture the effect of cropping system, irrigation, tillage, residue, and N-application rate within the bounds of experimental uncertainty, hence is now deemed a suitable tool for scenario analyses around the relevant practices.",Apurbo K.

Here we report a comprehensive evaluation of the capacity of APSIM for simulating the performance of CA and CT cropping practices under a diverse range of tillage (CT vs zero tillage (ZT)), crop establishment options (puddled transplanted rice vs unpuddled transplanted rice), residue, N rates, and irrigation practices from two sites in the EGP that differed in soil type, water table dynamics, and agro-climatic conditions. We followed a robust procedure of model parameterisation, calibration, and validation, then undertook statistical analyses to evaluate model performance. We have demonstrated that when different values for key model input parameters are employed (i.e. change in soil properties (Ks, BD)), crop rooting parameters (xf- root hospitality, kl- root extraction efficiency) and soil microorganism activity (Fbiom- fraction of soil organic matter present as microbial biomass and Finert- the inert fraction of soil organic matter), the model performed well in simulating the different performances of CA and CT management practices across the environments in the EGP. Model performance was markedly better in the full-N than in zero-N, but both are still considered acceptable. In addition to well-watered and fertilised treatments, the model was able to capture an observed crop failure in rainfed unpuddled transplanted rice accurately, illustrating an ability to capture crop response under a wide range of water stress environments. As demonstrated by robust statistical criteria, APSIM was able to capture the effect of cropping system, irrigation, tillage, residue, and N-application rate within the bounds of experimental uncertainty, hence is now deemed a suitable tool for scenario analyses around the relevant practices.",gpt-4.1,"Yes, the text discusses aspects that relate directly to soil health, such as changes in soil properties, soil microorganism activity, and soil organic matter fractions.",5

Intensive tillage practices demand more resources, damage soil quality, and reduce crop yields and profit margins. Crop diversification along with conservation agriculture (CA)-based management practices may reduce external input use, improve resource-use efficiency, and increase the productivity and profitability of intensive cropping systems. A field study was conducted on loamy soil in a sub-tropical climate in northern Bangladesh to evaluate the effects of three tillage options and six rice-based cropping sequences on grain, calorie, and protein yields and gross margins (GM) for different crops and cropping sequences. The three tillage options were: (1) conservation agriculture (CA) with all crops in sequences untilled, (2) alternating tillage (AT) with the monsoon season rice crop tilled but winter season crops untilled, and (3) conventional tillage (CT) with all crops in sequences tilled. The six cropping sequences were: rice-rice (R-R), rice-mung bean (Vigna radiata) (R-MB), rice-wheat (Triticum aestivum) (R-W), rice-maize (Zea mays) (R-M), rice-wheat-mung bean (R-W-MB), and rice-maize-mung bean (R-M-MB). Over three years of experimentation, the average monsoon rice yield was 8% lower for CA than CT, but the average winter crops yield was 13% higher for CA than CT. Systems rice equivalent yield (SREY) and systems calorie and protein yields were about 5%, 3% and 6%, respectively, higher under CA than CT; additionally, AT added approximately 1% more to these benefits. The systems productivity gain under CA and AT resulted in higher GM by 16% while reducing the labor and total production cost under CA than CT. The R-M rotation had higher SREY, calorie, protein yields, and GM by 24%, 26%, 66%, and 148%, respectively, than the predominantly practiced R-R rotation. The R-W-MB rotation had the highest SREY (30%) and second highest (118%) GM. Considering the combined effect of tillage and cropping system, CA with R-M rotation showed superior performance in terms of SREY, protein yield, and GM. The distribution of labor use and GM across rotations was grouped into four categories: R-W in low-low (low labor use and low GM), R-M in low-high (low labor use and high GM), R-W-MB and R-M-MB in high-high (high labor use and high GM) and R-R and R-MB in high-low (high labor use and low GM). In conclusion, CA performed better than CT in different winter crops and cropping systems but not in monsoon rice.

In sub-Saharan Africa, despite numerous efforts to address declining soil productivity, water scarcity, and increasing pest pressure through agroecological soil, water, and integrated pest management (IPM) practices, the adoption of such practices remains low. As part of the CGIAR Agroecology Initiative, we conducted a collaborative rapid innovation assessment of existing soil, water, and pest management practices in two Agroecological Living Landscapes (ALLs) in Makueni and Kiambu counties, Kenya. The assessment also included an evaluation of the performance of these practices and identified farmer preferences. Using a multi-stage approach, we applied stratified random sampling to identify 80 farmers for farm assessments and in-depth interviews. A total of 31 practices were identified, of which 26 were further evaluated. The evaluation revealed a heterogeneous set of socio-economic and biophysical contextual factors influencing practice performance. Respondents identified 19 strengths, and 13 challenges associated with the practices, highlighting opportunities for innovation to improve or adapt performance. Farmers also expressed preferences for future adoption of 31 practices, 77% of which were listed in one of the three focus areas, namely soil management, water management, or IPM. The other 33% were associated with multiple functions and were listed under two or three of the focus areas. The results of the collaborative assessment informed a broader co-design cycle that included participatory prioritization and selection of innovative practices, experimental design, and monitoring protocols. This collaborative and systematic approach was taken because innovative practices often fail to be adopted due to a lack of co-design and inclusion of local perspectives in innovation design, and a disconnect between science and practice. Our study highlights the importance of integrating stakeholder input and transdisciplinary technical expertise in the co-design and implementation of agroecological innovations. It also emphasizes the importance of using a structured methodology to understand farmers’ options, context, and preferences while co-designing locally relevant agroecological practices, which promotes holistic and inclusive adoption, successful implementation and long-term sustainability of agroecological practices.","Bolo, Peter (Alliance Bioversity-CIAT) <P.Bolo@cgiar.org>",(0) Not Targeted,(0) Not Targeted,(0) Not Targeted,(1) Significant,(0) Not Targeted,,0,,,,,,"CIAT (Alliance), CIFOR, ICRAF, IITA",,,,"Goal 2: Zero Hunger (2.3,2.4)

In Ethiopia, fertilizer application during the last four decades has led to significant yield gains, yet yield remains below its potential across much of the country. One of the main challenges responsible for low yield response to fertilizer application has been the use of ‘blanket’ recommendations, whereby no tailoring of fertilizer amount and frequency is done based on soil requirements. As a result, the amount of fertilizer applied ranges widely, and can be either sub- or supra-optimal. There is thus an increasing need for site-specific fertilizer recommendations which take into account site characteristics such as climate variables (temperature, rainfall, and solar radiation); soil factors (soil organic carbon, moisture, pH, texture, cation exchange capacity, and level of macro- and micronutrients); and topographic position indices. This article reports on a data-mining approach we developed on a large dataset of 6585 wheat (Triticum aestivum) field trials. The dataset includes detailed, site-specific biophysical variables to create nutrient response functions that can guide optimal site-specific fertilizer application. The approach used a machine-learning model (random forest) to capture the relationship between nutrients – nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), and sulfur (S) – and wheat yield. The model explained about 83, 82, 47, and 69% of variances of yield for N, P, K, and S omission, respectively, with consistent performance across training and testing datasets. Expectedly, for N and P omission data, the most important explanatory variables are nutrient rate, followed by soil organic carbon and soil pH. For K and S, however, climatic variables played an important role alongside nutrient rates. The site-specific yield–fertilizer response curves derived from our model are highly variable from location to location, as they are affected by the climatic, soil, or topographic conditions of the site. Importantly, using principal component analysis, we showed that the shape of the fertilizer response curves is a result of the multiple environmental factors (including soil, topography, and climate) that are at play at a given site, rather than of a specific dominant one. The research output is expected to respond to the national policy demands for a sound method to identify the optimal fertilizer rate to increase economic returns of fertilizer investments and take fertilizer utilization research one step further.",Wuletawu Abera,(1) Significant,(2) Principal,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,,0,,,,,Bioversity (Alliance),"CIAT (Alliance), CIMMYT, ICRISAT",,,,," • CIAT-BIOVERSITY - Alliance of Bioversity International & the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) [Innovation] - Italy

The agricultural sector in Sub-Saharan African countries encounters significant challenges in increasing crop production to meet the ever-growing food demand driven by population growth and economic development. Nutrient management is a critical component of crop production, yet nutrient input levels in the region are notably low. In many areas of cropland, nutrient balances are in deficit (Liu et al., 2010). At the recent Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Summit, African leaders pledged to strengthen nutrient management practices to enhance food production through increased fertilizer use.

In contrast, organic fertilizers are derived from naturally occurring materials. The use of organic fertilizers may offer additional long-term benefits, particularly for improving soil health. Notably, soil organic carbon is a key indicator of soil health, and organic fertilizers, being rich in carbon, can contribute to increasing soil carbon content. A study was conducted to evaluate the impact of organic fertilizers on crop productivity and soil health, focusing on maize production in Kenya. Maize is the primary staple crop in Kenya, with a harvested area of 2.1 million hectares, representing about 40% of the total harvested area for all crops in the country (FAOSTAT).

There is limited information on how catena features can be used to refine fertiliser recommendations in the undulating landscapes of the east African highlands.

Aims
(1) Determine the effects of landscape positions and soil types on crop-nutrient responses, and rainwater productivity (RWP); and (2) identify wheat yield-limiting nutrients across landscape positions.

Methods
Two sets of on-farm nutrient management experiments with wheat were conducted on foot slope, mid-slope, and hillslope positions over 71 sites in 2016 and 2019. The first experiment were on Vertisols, Nitisols, Regosols, and Cambisols with different levels of N/P2O5, K2O, and SO4. The second experiment were on Vertisols, Nitisols, and Cambisols with different levels of N/P2O5 and Zn.

Key results
NP increased yield across landscape positions. NP × K and NP × S interactions increased total biomass by 5–76%. Zinc × soil type interaction increased total biomass on Vertisols (6%) and Cambisols (9%), but increasing Zn did not improve yield on Nitisols. Zinc × landscape position interaction increased total biomass at foot slope (2%) and mid-slope (13%) positions. Zinc × NP interaction increased biomass yield on Cambisols, Nitisols, and Vertisols. N138P69 significantly increased RWP at foot slope, mid-slope, and hillslope positions. Soil nutrient and water contents decreased with increasing slope regardless of nutrient source and application rate.

Conclusions
Landscape position may be an indicator for targeting site-specific fertiliser recommendations. Farms on hillslopes could be better ameliorated by applying organic amendments with sustainable land management practices.

Implications
Taking into account landscape position can help better manage fertiliser use on undulating land in the east African highlands.",,(1) Significant,(0) Not Targeted,(0) Not Targeted,(2) Principal,(2) Principal,,0,,,,,,"ICRISAT, ILRI",,,,"Goal 2: Zero Hunger (2.3,2.4)

There is limited information on how catena features can be used to refine fertiliser recommendations in the undulating landscapes of the east African highlands.

Aims
(1) Determine the effects of landscape positions and soil types on crop-nutrient responses, and rainwater productivity (RWP); and (2) identify wheat yield-limiting nutrients across landscape positions.

Methods
Two sets of on-farm nutrient management experiments with wheat were conducted on foot slope, mid-slope, and hillslope positions over 71 sites in 2016 and 2019. The first experiment were on Vertisols, Nitisols, Regosols, and Cambisols with different levels of N/P2O5, K2O, and SO4. The second experiment were on Vertisols, Nitisols, and Cambisols with different levels of N/P2O5 and Zn.

Key results
NP increased yield across landscape positions. NP × K and NP × S interactions increased total biomass by 5–76%. Zinc × soil type interaction increased total biomass on Vertisols (6%) and Cambisols (9%), but increasing Zn did not improve yield on Nitisols. Zinc × landscape position interaction increased total biomass at foot slope (2%) and mid-slope (13%) positions. Zinc × NP interaction increased biomass yield on Cambisols, Nitisols, and Vertisols. N138P69 significantly increased RWP at foot slope, mid-slope, and hillslope positions. Soil nutrient and water contents decreased with increasing slope regardless of nutrient source and application rate.

Conclusions
Landscape position may be an indicator for targeting site-specific fertiliser recommendations. Farms on hillslopes could be better ameliorated by applying organic amendments with sustainable land management practices.

Implications
Taking into account landscape position can help better manage fertiliser use on undulating land in the east African highlands.",gpt-4.1,"Yes, the text discusses aspects that relate directly to soil health, such as soil properties, nutrient management, soil nutrient and water content, and the impact of landscape position on these factors.",8

Unbalanced plant nutrient management continues to be a major factor contributing to low maize (Zea mays L.) yields due to lack of information on the dose–responses to macronutrients on different soil types in Ethiopia. This study was carried out to quantify maize yield response and agronomic efficiency of varying application rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and sulphur (S) under balanced application of other nutrients across two soil types in Ethiopia. Field trials were set up on 29 farmers’ fields in four districts of Oromia and Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR) for three consecutive cropping seasons (2014–2017). The treatments consisted of six rates of N, P and S each and eight rates of K combined with balanced application of the remaining macronutrients, zinc (Zn) and boron (B). The treatments were laid out in randomised complete blocks design with three replicates per farm. Using nutrient dose–response modelling, the agronomic optimum rates of N, P, K and S were estimated at 46, 40, 17 and 10 kg ha−1 on Nitisols, with balanced application of the other nutrients. On Andosols, the optimum rates of N, P and S were estimated at 184, 20 and 30 kg ha−1, respectively, but the optimum K rate could not be estimated. The predicted maximum yields obtained with balanced nutrient application were lower on Andosols (3397–3640 kg ha−1) than on Nitisols (4630–6094 kg ha−1). Using the Mitscherlich dose–response model, the percentage deficiencies of N, P, K and S were estimated to be 1.3–3.3 times more on Nitisols than Andosols. Consequently, agronomic efficiencies of N, P, K and S were significantly lower on Andosols than on Nitisols. It is concluded that balanced application of 46 kg N ha−1 , 40 kg P ha−1 , 17 kg K ha−1 , 10 kg ha−1 S, 2 kg Zn ha−1 and 0.5 kg B ha−1 could be recommended for maize on Nitisols in the study area. Although this recommendation may also apply to Andosol, further research is needed as the productivity of Andosols appears to be limited by constrains other than N, P, K, S, Zn and B. We also recommend a shift from the blanket fertilizer recommendations to site-specific nutrient management based on good understanding of the variations in crop response with soil type and agroecology and appropriate soil and plant analyses.","Tamene, Lulseged D.",(1) Significant,(1) Significant,Not applicable,Not applicable,Not applicable,,0,,,,,CIMMYT,ICRISAT,,,,," • CIAT-BIOVERSITY - Alliance of Bioversity International & the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) [Innovation] - Italy

Therefore, the present study analysed the effect of intensive irrigated rice cropping on nutrient concentrations in soils and rice (grain and straw at harvest) in two long-term experiments that were established in 1991 for intensive rice-based irrigated systems in the Senegal River valley at Ndiaye and Fanaye, Senegal. The experiments included six different fertilizer treatments and rice was grown for two seasons per year. The samples were collected in the 2016/17 dry season (26 years or 52nd continuous rice cropping season after the establishment). Average grain yields from 1991 to 2016/17 for the different fertilizer treatments indicate that yield was limited by N and P at both sites. At Ndiaye, 120 kg N ha−1 seemed sufficient to reach highest achievable yields, whereas 180 kg N ha−1 was necessary at Fanaye. Soil organic carbon and total soil N did increase considerably over the full length of the experiment at both sites and in all treatments even though all crop residues were removed every season. The estimated increase in total topsoil N (across all fertilizer treatments) per season was 10.8 and 11.4 kg N ha−1 at Ndiaye and Fanaye, respectively. Fertilizer treatments differed in their N, P and K rate but significant effects on total soil concentrations were only detected for P. Using the Mehlich3 soil test, we analysed treatment effects on available P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Mn, Zn and Fe. Critical Mehlich3 values from the literature indicated likely P limitation at both sites and in all but one treatment (high PK treatment), a starting but minor K limitation at Fanaye, a strong S limitation at Fanaye, and a minor Zn limitation at Fanaye and Ndiaye. These indications were mostly confirmed by the grain and straw analysis but with the exception of the P limitation, the actual effect of these possible nutrient limitations on production would need to be tested with targeted field experiments. We conclude that continuous rice cultivation in the Sahel for 26 years can be sustained and even increases soil organic carbon and total soil nitrogen. However, in addition to the common N and P deficiencies, likely deficiencies of K, S and Zn are appearing and may begin to limit rice yields in intensive systems in Africa.

Mid-season drainage can reduce iron toxicity, which is one of the major constraints to rice production in this region, and increase rice yield and water productivity. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of mid-season drainage on iron toxicity, rice yield, and water productivity and identify the factors that favor rice yield in the fields with mid-season drainage relative to continuous flooding. Methods: Experiments were conducted during the wet season over two years in 30 farmers’ fields in two irrigated schemes in the region of Bouake, central Cˆ ote d ′Ivoire. Each farmer’s field was subdivided into three plots consisting of three water management practices: continuous flooding, mid-season drainage at 25 days after transplanting followed by two drying phases of seven days each separated by a flooded phase of three days or by alternate wetting and drying. Results: Large variations in soil properties, management practices, iron toxicity score (based on leaf bronzing), rice yield, and water productivity were observed in farmers’ fields. Under continuous flooding, lower rice yield was associated with higher iron toxicity, and this was observed in the fields with higher soil organic carbon, and in which farmers applied lower amounts of phosphorus fertilizer. Mid-season drainage practices significantly reduced iron toxicity, irrigation water amount, and relatively increased water productivity. On average across farmers’ fields, rice yield was not significantly different among water management practices. However, when data at the individual field level were considered to calculate differences between the treatments, gains in rice yield in the fields with mid-season drainage at 25 days after transplanting followed by alternate wetting and drying relative to continuous flooding were associated with higher soil organic carbon, earlier application of the second split of fertilizer, and a large reduction in the iron toxicity score in the fields with mid-season drainage at 25 days after transplanting followed by alternate wetting and drying compared to continuous flooding. Conclusions: Mid-season drainage at 25 days after transplanting followed by alternate wetting and drying combined with appropriate fertilizer management could be recommended to the smallholder farmers to reduce iron toxicity, and increase rice yield and water productivity in fields with high soil organic carbon and iron toxicity.

Alternate wetting and moderate soil drying irrigation (i.e., re-irrigation when the water level reaches 15 cm below the soil surface) has proven to be an efficient water-saving technology in semi-arid zones of West Africa, reducing water inputs without yield penalty. Alternate wetting and severe soil drying (AWD30), by re-irrigating fields only when the water table reaches 30 cm below the soil surface, may further reduce water inputs compared to farmers’ irrigation practices (FP).

Results_x000D_
All 10 nutrients were reasonably predicted [Nakagawa’s R2 ranging from 0.27 (Ca) to 0.79 (B), and modeling efficiency ranging from 0.178 (Ca) to 0.584 (B)].

Zinc is a critical trace element for human health, and therefore, more equitable food systems. Zinc deficiency in soil can affect plant growth and yield. The capacity of Urochloa grasses to biologically inhibit nitrification (BNI) and fix nitrogen in the soil, has been shown to improve soil health and crop productivity. In this study, we evaluated the effect of Urochloa grasses subsequently cultivated with maize on the zinc concentration in the grain. We conducted a two-year experiment in 20×20 m plots with nine Urochloa genotypes and a bare soil control, followed by four consecutive cycles of biofortified maize (SGBIOH2). Our results showed an average increase of 9.32 mg/kg of zinc in maize grain compared to the content observed in the control. The genotypes U. humidicola Uh 72 and Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu showed the highest zinc concentrations during the planting cycles, at 37.29 mg/kg and 36.18 mg/kg, respectively, compared to the average of 25.83 mg/kg in the control treatment. Maize rotation as a subsequent crop of Urochloa grasses had a highly positive effect on zinc concentrations in the grain, enhancing its biofortifying properties. In the soil analysis, high levels of phosphorus were reported, which is inversely related to soil zinc content. Phosphorus is an essential element to produce ATP, the molecule that gives energy to the nitrifying bacteria that carry out nitrification. This may decrease the solubility and mobility of zinc, which in turn affects the nutritional quality of the plants. Brachialactone, an organic compound present in the roots of Urochloa grass, plays an important role in this interaction as it has been scientifically demonstrated that has the potential to inhibit soil microbial activity responsible for nitrification processes. By inhibiting nitrification thanks to the BNI potential of pastures and the root system of a biofortified crop, it is possible to extract and mobilise more zinc from the soil through the roots and plant tissues.

A review,"A common theme emerging from nutrient omission trials conducted extensively across sub-Saharan Africa has been the large variability in yield response to applied nutrients. Yet, little is known about the factors associated with this variability. Therefore, the objectives of this review were to (1) synthesize the available data from nutrient omission trials of maize and rice and quantify spatial variability in yield responses and the probability of attaining specified yield targets; (2) identify the genotypic, environmental, and nutrient management factors associated with yield responses; and (3) provide insights and actionable information for setting priorities for future nutrient management research and development. Here, we provide distributions and expected values of yield response and agronomic efficiencies of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) to serve as benchmarks for improving fertilizer recommendations. We also show that with the combined application of NPK fertilizer, rain-fed maize and rice yields can be raised from the current yields of ~2 Mg ha−1 to 4 Mg ha−1. Yield responses to N, P, and K were in the ratio of 11:6:1 in maize and 13:7:5 in rice, probably arising from differences in uptake requirements and growing environments. K yield responses were 2–3 times higher in rice than in maize. Explorative analysis using machine learning algorithms provided further insights into the possible interaction of agroecology, soil type, and exchangeable cations on the spatial variability in yield responses to N, P, and K in maize and rice. We recommend future research to address site-specific interactions between the applied and indigenous soil nutrients, focusing on optimizing application rates of K, other macronutrients and micronutrients for sustainable intensification of maize and rice production.

This is the case for Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). At the same time, intense farming practices (particularly on sloped land), deforestation activities, mining extraction operations, challenges in agriculture water management, and soil erosion all contribute to increased land vulnerability. The purpose of this study was to review how the risks of natural disasters related to flooding, landslides, and soil erosion are assessed, measured, managed, and mitigated in the central highlands of Africa, specifically in Rwanda, Burundi, and the DRC. In this process, the risks and the current status of disaster risk management, early warning systems, soil and land conservation practices, and risk mapping were investigated for the three countries.

The literature review revealed a high risk for landslides, flooding, and soil erosion in the region. Risk maps covered the potential risks and helped identify the vulnerable areas. Most of them vary in spatial data, methods, and classifications. They rely on input data on elevation, slope, rainfall, lithology, soil texture, land use, land cover, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The use of heterogeneous data sets and geographical regions in these risk maps may lead to diverging interpretations of potential risks and ‘hot spots’ in spatial terms and the underlying drivers of those risks. None of the risk maps take into account existing population vulnerabilities such as social protection, income levels, or readiness to act in an emergency, such as hospital access in an emergency. Risk maps could be an effective tool for supporting disaster risk management policies and implementations if they are nationally based and built on comprehensive, comparable, and reliable data.

With the rise of climate change-related risks, the need for expended risk mapping is expected to grow. Vegetation cover, deep-rooted vegetation, and soil management practices such as terraces, green barriers, drainage systems for overflows, or similar physical structures are useful land management practices that can reduce risks. Such practices, however, are not in place to the necessary extent in the region. In the case of disaster risk management, although strategies and action plans do exist, the study faced significant constraints in verifying their implementation and therefore, their effectiveness.

In Madhya Pradesh, India, land degradation along with difficult terrain, and poor soil conditions make significant portions of land unfit for cultivation leading to the migration of tribal communities. These degraded or sporadically cultivated lands are caught in a vicious cycle leading to further degradation.

A cost-effective agroecological approach to transform degraded lands into productive assets using natural amendments is crucial for improving agricultural diversity, soil health, and overall ecosystem services. It also helps alleviate the pressure of intensive farming on other lands. Moreover, this practice holds promise for reversing migration among tribal communities.

The CGIAR’s Agroecology Initiative, in collaboration with local tribal farmers and stakeholders, has co-designed an innovative practice locally popularized as Krishi Kund (micro-site improvement with agriculture pits). This practice focuses on improving micro-sites rather than entire parcels of land using organic amendments. In this method, small cylindrical pits (did: 60cm, depth 60cm) are excavated at 1.2m intervals, filled with locally available organic materials such as cow dung compost, vermicompost, plant biomass, and organic inoculants, and then covered with sieved soil. This approach improves approximately 20% (6450 pits per hectare) of the land area, resulting in a similar yield of fully restored land.

Circular depressions around each pit serve as micro catchments, conserving rainwater on-site. This technique effectively enhances soil physical condition, fertility, water retention, thermal buffering leading to successful crop establishment and production. Drought tolerant crops viz pigeon pea, caster for the poor water availability sites and other cash crops including vegetables at sites of water availability are being grown. A two-year recovery period was estimated for the cost incurred on land restoration.

Krishi Kund offers a resource-efficient alternative for restoring degraded lands by concentrating organic materials within specific areas and minimising soil loss. This method aligns with the goal of achieving Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) and can significantly contribute to fulfiling Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15.3, which aims to end desertification and restore degraded land.",,(0) Not Targeted,(0) Not Targeted,(0) Not Targeted,(2) Principal,(0) Not Targeted,,0,,,,,,IWMI,,,,"Goal 2: Zero Hunger (2.3,2.4)

The project addresses several challenges, including soil erosion, fodder scarcity, and reduced tree cover. Agroforestry systems such as block plantations, silvipasture, and integrated farming were implemented to restore these degraded lands. The collaboration with BAIF, Pune along with CGIAR partners The Alliance Bioversity International-CIAT and International Water Management Institute, carried out this study with focus on the impact of restoration interventions on biodiversity, soil health, and carbon sequestration._x000D_
A micro-watershed of about 63 hectare was identified in Chicondi village to implement technological interventions. The activities carried out under this project include the successful establishment of three agroforestry models—Fodder, Wadi, and Bamboo—on farmers' fields in Chichondi Village. Species like Mango and Bamboo were identified as priority species for plantation, with fodder scarcity being the most critical issue, as indicated by the constraints ranking. The Wadi system, dominated by Mango and Teak, played a key role in addressing both nutritional needs and environmental security. These systems also contributed significantly to biomass, carbon sequestration, and oxygen production._x000D_
A comprehensive biodiversity assessment revealed significant variation in species richness and diversity across different land-use systems. The Bamboo system (New) exhibited the highest biodiversity, with a Shannon-Wiener Index of 3.7225 and species richness of 77, while the Agriculture Fallow system had the lowest biodiversity (Shannon-Wiener Index = 2.6469, Species Richness = 19). These findings underscore the importance of habitat-specific conservation strategies to maintain ecosystem health and support biodiversity._x000D_
Soil properties showed variations in soil parameters, including pH, electrical conductivity, organic carbon content, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels across the systems. Soil pH ranged from 5.09 in the Wadi Control system to 6.51 in the Forest system, while organic carbon content varied from 0.55% in the Wadi Control system to 1.90% in the Forest system. These variations highlight the significant role of different agroforestry systems in improving soil health._x000D_
Carbon sequestration studies showed that forest systems had the highest carbon stock at 112.9 Mg/ha, followed by agricultural fallow systems at 94.61 Mg/ha and Wadi systems at 75.34 Mg/ha. The Wadi control system, lacking tree cover, had the lowest carbon stock at 46.01 Mg/ha. Wadi agroforestry systems, dominated by Mango and Teak, significantly contributed to carbon sequestration, with 16.60 Mg/ha of carbon stock and 4.32 Mg/ha of CO₂ sequestration.

The project addresses several challenges, including soil erosion, fodder scarcity, and reduced tree cover. Agroforestry systems such as block plantations, silvipasture, and integrated farming were implemented to restore these degraded lands. The collaboration with BAIF, Pune along with CGIAR partners The Alliance Bioversity International-CIAT and International Water Management Institute, carried out this study with focus on the impact of restoration interventions on biodiversity, soil health, and carbon sequestration._x000D_
A micro-watershed of about 63 hectare was identified in Chicondi village to implement technological interventions. The activities carried out under this project include the successful establishment of three agroforestry models—Fodder, Wadi, and Bamboo—on farmers' fields in Chichondi Village. Species like Mango and Bamboo were identified as priority species for plantation, with fodder scarcity being the most critical issue, as indicated by the constraints ranking. The Wadi system, dominated by Mango and Teak, played a key role in addressing both nutritional needs and environmental security. These systems also contributed significantly to biomass, carbon sequestration, and oxygen production._x000D_
A comprehensive biodiversity assessment revealed significant variation in species richness and diversity across different land-use systems. The Bamboo system (New) exhibited the highest biodiversity, with a Shannon-Wiener Index of 3.7225 and species richness of 77, while the Agriculture Fallow system had the lowest biodiversity (Shannon-Wiener Index = 2.6469, Species Richness = 19). These findings underscore the importance of habitat-specific conservation strategies to maintain ecosystem health and support biodiversity._x000D_
Soil properties showed variations in soil parameters, including pH, electrical conductivity, organic carbon content, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels across the systems. Soil pH ranged from 5.09 in the Wadi Control system to 6.51 in the Forest system, while organic carbon content varied from 0.55% in the Wadi Control system to 1.90% in the Forest system. These variations highlight the significant role of different agroforestry systems in improving soil health._x000D_
Carbon sequestration studies showed that forest systems had the highest carbon stock at 112.9 Mg/ha, followed by agricultural fallow systems at 94.61 Mg/ha and Wadi systems at 75.34 Mg/ha. The Wadi control system, lacking tree cover, had the lowest carbon stock at 46.01 Mg/ha. Wadi agroforestry systems, dominated by Mango and Teak, significantly contributed to carbon sequestration, with 16.60 Mg/ha of carbon stock and 4.32 Mg/ha of CO₂ sequestration. These systems also produced 20.91 Mg/ha of oxygen, with Mango contributing 9.01 Mg/ha and Teak 8.06 Mg/ha. _x000D_

However, this reliance often leads to imbalanced nutrition and irregular income, exacerbated by monoculture farming practices and diminishing forest resources. Coupled with widespread migration, gender inequality, and social alienation, these challenges perpetuate a cycle of poverty and malnutrition within these communities.
To address these issues, an Agroecological Homestead Model (AHM) has been developed and promoted for adoption. Unlike regions with limited land holdings, tribal farmers in this region possess sizable but degraded land. The AHM utilises homesteads, employing water harvesting and storage systems for irrigation, multi-layer cultivation, crop rotation, horticulture plants, applying natural amendments, composting, backyard poultry and goat rearing, using local seed varieties, and nutrient rich fodder for livestock. Community engagement is facilitated through resource aggregation for bio-input production, planting materials and collective marketing efforts.
Implemented on less than 0.1 hectares, the AHM, predominantly managed by women, accommodates 10 to 16 types of vegetable/crops annually.

Key interventions included Agroecological Homestead Models (AHMs), Krishi-Kund for land restoration, Solar Irrigation Systems based diversified farming, Integrated Farming Systems (IFS), Integrated Rice-Fish Farming, and homeopathic formulations for crop improvement.

Preliminary results highlight promising outcomes. AHMs demonstrated income diversification, with gross returns 7.9 to 22.5 times higher and net returns also showing improvement, albeit constrained by high initial costs. Microsite improvements enhanced productivity by 2.39 to 5.71 times compared to control sites, with net returns ranging from 0.74 to 4.36 times higher. Solar irrigation reduced fossil fuel dependence and enabled initial crop diversification. IFS models showed net incomes of ₹22,395 to ₹54,563 (USD 259 to USD 630) with benefit-cost ratios ranging from 1.5 to 1.8, water productivity in the range of INR 5.6 to 10.3 per cubic meter of water used demonstrating the potential to enhance resource use efficiency, resilience, and income diversification. Integrated Rice-Fish Farming improved soil health, dietary diversity, and incomes, while initial farmer trials of a homeopathic solution indicated yield improvements of 1.12 to 1.61 times compared to their own controls. Based on the limited replicates, simple experimental designs and short duration of the trials, these results remain preliminary. Further validations and assessments of cost-effectiveness, return on investment, and performance consistency under multi-seasonal climatic variability and a larger number of samples have been suggested.

Key lessons include the importance of integrating traditional knowledge with scientific practices, leveraging women-led groups for adoption, and implementing targeted capacity-building programs. Challenges such as climatic variability, delayed adoption, and limited market access highlight the need for adaptive strategies and extended experimentation.

leading food companies such as Nestlé. Given that a large proportion of emissions in supply chains occur during the
production of commodities, focus has converged on Regenerative Agriculture as a key strategy to achieve
those goals. The Regenerative Agriculture agenda coalesces around three main goals:
• Reduce the Carbon Footprint
• Enhance Soil Health
• Enhance and safeguard Biodiversity
alongside commitments to enhance smallholder producers’ incomes, to avoid child labour and to ensure a sustainable
supply. 
The Ground Zero project aims to provide a framework of robust, easily measurable and verifiable indicators
and methods for the assessment of the carbon footprint, soil health and biodiversity in cocoa and coffee production
systems. The project is organised around four work packages (WPs): WP1 – Coordination; WP2 – Carbon Footprints; WP3 – Soil Health; WP4 – Biodiversity.

Let’s get real on regeneration! Report 1: State of the art and indicator selection The urgency with which the world needs to combat climate change has led to ambitious commitments by
leading food companies such as Nestlé. Given that a large proportion of emissions in supply chains occur during the
production of commodities, focus has converged on Regenerative Agriculture as a key strategy to achieve
those goals. The Regenerative Agriculture agenda coalesces around three main goals:
• Reduce the Carbon Footprint
• Enhance Soil Health
• Enhance and safeguard Biodiversity
alongside commitments to enhance smallholder producers’ incomes, to avoid child labour and to ensure a sustainable
supply. 
The Ground Zero project aims to provide a framework of robust, easily measurable and verifiable indicators
and methods for the assessment of the carbon footprint, soil health and biodiversity in cocoa and coffee production
systems. The project is organised around four work packages (WPs): WP1 – Coordination; WP2 – Carbon Footprints; WP3 – Soil Health; WP4 – Biodiversity.

Restoring soil pH to optimal ranges for agriculture can have a significant impact on yields, particularly for acid intolerant crops like wheat and barley. The application of agricultural lime is the standard corrective, although the large application requirements, lack of farmer awareness, and weak or non-existent lime supply chains make this a complex problem to address at scale. To date, no large-scale farmer trials of lime application have been undertaken in Ethiopia. This leaves open the question to local policy makers as to the economic benefits given the enormous capital and logistics investments required. To help address this we leverage existing spatial edaphic data and longitudinal crop surveys to simulate the productivity impact of varying lime and fertilizer applications.

In addition, at lower pH levels our models indicate that commonly used nitrogen-based fertilizers are less cost-effective. For wheat in highly acidic soils, we find that fertilizers cost over two times as much as a single application of lime over a five-year period. The cost savings of the use of lime reaches as high as 121% of average one-year agricultural household income for wheat; with barley these savings are lower but still substantial at 24%.

Genotype BRS268 showed higher yield (1319.83 kg ha-1) under lime untreated acid soil than lime treated acid soil (1143.47 kg ha-1) and showed less reduction percentage for a number of the nodules, root weight, and number of seeds per plant; while PI567046A showed high reduction percentage for yield, biomass, number of pod and seed per plant. A high difference was observed among the soybean genotypes for soil acidity tolerance, which might be further exploited by breeders for the genetic improvement of soybean. Genotype BRS268 had performed better than other tested genotypes under increased soil acidity. selection would be effective to improve soybean genotypes performance on acid soils and identify low Phosphorus tolerant genotype that helps smallholder farmers optimize soybean productivity on acid soils in the study area. HAWASSA-04 variety is the most tolerant among the tested materials. However, further study is required by considering additional genotypes to reach a conclusive recommendation",gpt-4.1,"Yes, the text discusses aspects that relate directly to soil health, specifically soil acidity, nutrient availability, and the use of lime to amend acidic soils.",14

Defined as interventions that leverage the protective, restorative, and regulatory functions of ecosystems (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016), NBS offers a holistic approach to addressing a range of environmental and societal challenges. This framework positions humans as active stewards of ecosystems rather than passive beneficiaries. Industrial agriculture, in prioritizing mass-scale food production, has exacted a heavy toll on both the environment and human well-being. Miralles-Wilhelm and Iseman (2021) report that 52 percent of global agricultural lands suffer from moderate to severe degradation due to unsustainable practices, contributing to 25 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, industrial agriculture drives 80 percent of deforestation, threatens 86 percent of the 28,000 species currently at risk of extinction (through habitat conversion and pollution), and accelerates soil and water degradation. The use of chemical inputs, monocropping, and poor waste management further compromise nutrition, reduce crop resilience, and depress farming incomes. These challenges highlight the urgent need to transition toward resilient, nature positive agricultural systems capable of sustaining smallholder farmers and ensuring that agriculture becomes a net contributor to environmental restoration. In response, the One CGIAR initiative, ""Nature-positive solutions for shifting agri-food systems to more resilient and sustainable pathways"" (NATURE+), seeks to enhance the adoption of nature-positive solutions (NPS) to promote sustainable agricultural productivity. NATURE+ addresses key systemic barriers in three areas: (1) land degradation and resource depletion, (2) limited evidence and knowledge gaps within the agricultural research for development (AR4D) community, and (3) the lack of viable business models to drive public-private partnerships in sustainable agriculture. While the harmful impacts of industrial agriculture are well documented, the AR4D community lacks robust evidence and tailored tools to support NPS planning. The 2021 UN Food Systems Summit and the COVID-19 pandemic have further underscored the need for systemic transformation. The 2020 World Economic Forum report, ""The Future of Nature and Business,"" estimates that NPS could create 395 million jobs by 2030, but achieving this potential requires substantial investment in evidence-based innovation and decision-support tools for biodiversity enhancement, soil management, waste management, and water conservation.",Carlo Azzarri,(0) Not Targeted,(1) Significant,(1) Significant,(2) Principal,(1) Significant,,0,,,,,,IFPRI,,,,"Goal 1: No Poverty (1.1,1.2,1.4,1.5,1.b)

Defined as interventions that leverage the protective, restorative, and regulatory functions of ecosystems (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016), NBS offers a holistic approach to addressing a range of environmental and societal challenges. This framework positions humans as active stewards of ecosystems rather than passive beneficiaries. Industrial agriculture, in prioritizing mass-scale food production, has exacted a heavy toll on both the environment and human well-being. Miralles-Wilhelm and Iseman (2021) report that 52 percent of global agricultural lands suffer from moderate to severe degradation due to unsustainable practices, contributing to 25 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, industrial agriculture drives 80 percent of deforestation, threatens 86 percent of the 28,000 species currently at risk of extinction (through habitat conversion and pollution), and accelerates soil and water degradation. The use of chemical inputs, monocropping, and poor waste management further compromise nutrition, reduce crop resilience, and depress farming incomes. These challenges highlight the urgent need to transition toward resilient, nature positive agricultural systems capable of sustaining smallholder farmers and ensuring that agriculture becomes a net contributor to environmental restoration. In response, the One CGIAR initiative, ""Nature-positive solutions for shifting agri-food systems to more resilient and sustainable pathways"" (NATURE+), seeks to enhance the adoption of nature-positive solutions (NPS) to promote sustainable agricultural productivity. NATURE+ addresses key systemic barriers in three areas: (1) land degradation and resource depletion, (2) limited evidence and knowledge gaps within the agricultural research for development (AR4D) community, and (3) the lack of viable business models to drive public-private partnerships in sustainable agriculture. While the harmful impacts of industrial agriculture are well documented, the AR4D community lacks robust evidence and tailored tools to support NPS planning. The 2021 UN Food Systems Summit and the COVID-19 pandemic have further underscored the need for systemic transformation. The 2020 World Economic Forum report, ""The Future of Nature and Business,"" estimates that NPS could create 395 million jobs by 2030, but achieving this potential requires substantial investment in evidence-based innovation and decision-support tools for biodiversity enhancement, soil management, waste management, and water conservation.",gpt-4.1,"Yes, the text discusses aspects that relate directly to the health of soils, including soil degradation, soil management, and the impacts of industrial agriculture on soil health.",16

Agricultural practices like monocropping and intercropping shape the soil microbiome and rootassociated microbial communities in longan orchards. Monocropping, where a single crop species is cultivated in an area, is a common approach. In contrast, intercropping involves growing multiple crop species together, offering benefits such as resource efficiency and pest management. These practices can impact microbial diversity, community composition, and ecosystem function in longan agroecosystems. Additionally, organic management, particularly the use of organic versus inorganic fertilizers, might also influence soil microbial communities. High organic practices reduce reliance on synthetic fertilizers, promoting soil health and sustainability. Conversely, low organic practices prioritize synthetic fertilizers, potentially impacting microbial diversity and ecosystem stability negatively._x000D_

In the pursuit of sustainable agricultural practices, it becomes important to explore and evaluate the microbial diversity within the soil. Bacterial and fungal communities within the soil are pivotal for nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and the overall health of the agroecosystem. Furthermore, the assessment of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) diversity in root systems adds a crucial layer to our understanding, as these symbiotic fungi play a fundamental role in nutrient uptake by plants.

As the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems, soil health and biodiversity play pivotal roles in nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and overall ecosystem resilience (Berendsen et al., 2012). Recognizing the significance of these factors in sustaining crop yields, the current study focuses on assessing microbial diversity in both soil and root of longan fruit (Dimocarpus longan) plantations in Son La Province. Longan is a tropical and sub-tropical plant. In Vietnam, longan is grown quite popularly in all parts of the country from North to South.

This extensive land use represents a significant opportunity cost, as it could otherwise be used to conserve biodiversity, such as wetlands and forests, produce cash and food crops or sequester carbon.  Current use limits the potential for preserving different biomes and enhancing biodiversity, leading to land degradation due to overgrazing and poor nutrient or fertilizer management. Additionally, livestock production is water-intensive and a major source of water pollution caused by run-off from fertilizers, pesticides and animal waste. As a result, livestock is considered a significant contributor to global environmental degradation, impacting climate change, land and soil health, water resources and biodiversity and altering the nutrient cycles to the detriment of ecosystem wealth at the landscape level.  Livestock farming poses significant environmental challenges, creating negative feedback loops with climate change that affect mitigation and adaptation efforts. Overgrazing damages the land, leading to poor soil quality and reduced productivity (Asner et al. 2004), while pasture expansion contributes to deforestation, destroying habitats and exacerbating climate change (Pendrill et al. 2019). Recent estimates suggest that livestock production accounts for approximately 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a reduction from previous estimates of 14.5% (Poore and Nemecek 2018).  In 2015, livestock agri-food systems emitted around 6 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent, with projections indicating that emissions could rise to nearly 9 billion tonnes by 2050 without significant interventions (FAO 2023). Agriculture contributes 40% of the global human-caused methane emissions, of which the largest part (32%) comes from manure and enteric fermentation from livestock (CCAC and UNEP 2021). Due to population and income growth, the demand for livestock is expected to increase by up to 70% by 2050 (Ranganathan 2018), which, unabated, will increase methane emissions proportionally. This environmental footprint creates negative feedback loops with climate change, affecting mitigation and adaptation efforts. Deteriorating environmental health increases the vulnerability of livestock production and societies to climate change, limiting adaptation options and reducing overall productivity, which further drives up greenhouse gas emission intensities. As global demand for animal products rises, the environmental footprint of livestock is expected to grow, worsening these challenges.  Reducing the environmental footprint of livestock production is critical to achieving global climate goals and mitigating the severe impacts of climate change and for maintaining the livelihoods of 1.7 billion people and 60% of rural households in developing countries.

The livestock sector plays a key role in fulfilling human food needs because it provides high amounts of protein and micronutrients per unit of product (Herrero et al., 2021). In developing countries, livestock systems substantially contribute to increasing livelihood resilience for many smallholders and offer ways to lift people out of poverty by providing regular income and employment (World Bank, 2009).

These disruptions to agricultural production cycles exacerbate food shortages. Land degradation, driven by deforestation, overgrazing, and unsustainable farming practices, further diminishes soil fertility and reduces agricultural productivity. Agroecology offers a promising pathway towards more sustainable and resilient agricultural systems. ISFM, which synergistically combines organic fertilizers, mineral fertilizers, and improved germplasm, is seen as a pivotal entry point for transitioning smallholder farming systems in Africa towards agroecological production. This study aimed to assess the adoption levels of Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) practices among male and female sorghum farmers in Zimbabwe, analyze existing sorghum production systems, identify gender-based disparities in access to and utilization of ISFM technologies and inputs, and develop context-specific recommendations for enhancing sorghum productivity, ecosystem services, and livelihoods through agroecological ISFM strategies.  The study was conducted in Hwange District, Zimbabwe, a semi-arid region reliant on rain-fed agriculture. Data collection involved in-depth interviews with selected farmers using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize quantitative data. This study provides snapshot on the current state of ISFM practices among smallholder farmers in Hwange District, Zimbabwe.  The study revealed a mixed picture of ISFM adoption among sorghum farmers in Zimbabwe. While encouraging trends exist, such as the high adoption of improved varieties (76.20% for females and 78.50% for males) and the widespread use of intercropping (around 50% for both genders), several challenges hinder optimal ISFM implementation. A significant proportion of farmers utilize improved varieties and apply basal and top-dressing fertilizers, indicating a degree of adoption of input-based approaches. However, the application rates of these inputs are often suboptimal. Sorghum yields have exhibited significant variability and a decline over recent seasons, highlighting the vulnerability of production systems to climate shocks, such as the 2023/24 El Niño-induced drought. Over-reliance on crop production, particularly sorghum, exposes households to significant climate-related risks and limits livelihood diversification opportunities. Significant gender disparities exist in access to key agricultural assets, limiting women's ability to adopt and implement effective ISFM practices. While the overall gender disparities in the adoption of some practices are minimal, there are notable differences in access to resources and inputs, such as land, livestock, and agricultural machinery, which can significantly impact women's ability to adopt and benefit from ISFM practices. The study observed sub-optimal utilization of several key ISFM practices, including low rates of manure and fertilizer application, limited adoption of composting and mobile kraaling, and a slight decline in the use of intercropping and residue mulching. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to address the identified challenges and enhance the adoption and effectiveness of ISFM practices among sorghum farmers in Zimbabwe.

To enhance the effectiveness of ISFM practices, it is crucial to address gender disparities by ensuring equitable access to resources, technology, and decision-making power for women farmers. This can be achieved through targeted interventions to improve women's access to critical agricultural assets. Furthermore, diversifying livelihoods through the adoption of agroforestry systems, promoting drought-resilient practices like drought-tolerant varieties and infield water harvesting, and supporting the development of local value-addition enterprises can enhance resilience and improve farmer incomes. To optimize ISFM practices, it is essential to encourage the adoption of labour-saving technologies such as direct seeders and rippers, promote microdosing techniques for fertilizer application, and enhance manure management practices by promoting composting and exploring alternative organic resources. Additionally, introducing composting education in schools can nurture a culture of composting among younger generations. Promoting and supporting the adoption of mobile kraaling technology through training programs and facilitating collective action among farmers can address labour constraints and improve soil health. Exploring alternative uses for crop residues, such as animal feed, while prioritizing their use for in-situ mulching, can also contribute to soil fertility improvement. Finally, providing farmers with guidance on selecting appropriate intercropping combinations based on soil type, climate conditions, and market demands, along with conducting practical training programs on the proper construction and utilization of basins and ripping techniques, emphasizing their benefits for water conservation and soil health, are crucial for optimizing the implementation of ISFM practices.",,(1) Significant,(1) Significant,(1) Significant,(1) Significant,(0) Not Targeted,,0,,,,,,ICRISAT,,,,"Goal 2: Zero Hunger (2.3,2.4)

This study investigates the compounded effects of armed conflicts and climate-induced disruptions on agricultural input use in Ethiopia, a country experiencing significant fragility due to both factors. Using a unique household- and plot-level panel dataset collected before (2019) and after (2023) the onset of a widespread conflict, we examine how these disruptions affect the use of key agricultural inputs, such as inorganic fertilizers, improved seeds, agrochemicals, compost, and manure. The analysis reveals that exposure to conflict significantly reduces the likelihood of using both inorganic and organic inputs. Conflict-affected households are 9 percentage points less likely to use both inorganic fertilizers and improved seeds, and 14 percentage points less likely to use organic fertilizers, such as compost and manure. Exposure to recurrent rainfall variability by inducing uncertainty of use of inputs further exacerbates these negative impacts, reducing fertilizer use by an additional 3 percent among drought-exposed households. These findings highlight the multifaceted challenges faced by smallholder farmers in fragile settings, where both conflict and environmental stressors undermine agricultural productivity and threaten food security.

This study investigates the compounded effects of armed conflicts and climate-induced disruptions on agricultural input use in Ethiopia, a country experiencing significant fragility due to both factors. Using a unique household- and plot-level panel dataset collected before (2019) and after (2023) the onset of a widespread conflict, we examine how these disruptions affect the use of key agricultural inputs, such as inorganic fertilizers, improved seeds, agrochemicals, compost, and manure. The analysis reveals that exposure to conflict significantly reduces the likelihood of using both inorganic and organic inputs. Conflict-affected households are 9 percentage points less likely to use both inorganic fertilizers and improved seeds, and 14 percentage points less likely to use organic fertilizers, such as compost and manure. Exposure to recurrent rainfall variability by inducing uncertainty of use of inputs further exacerbates these negative impacts, reducing fertilizer use by an additional 3 percent among drought-exposed households. These findings highlight the multifaceted challenges faced by smallholder farmers in fragile settings, where both conflict and environmental stressors undermine agricultural productivity and threaten food security. The study underscores the need for targeted anticipatory (pre-conflict) and resilience building (post-conflict) interventions to support resilience in agricultural practices within conflict-affected regions, particularly those facing climate-induced weather risks.",gpt-4.1,"Yes, the text discusses aspects that relate directly to the health of soils, specifically through its focus on the use of organic and inorganic fertilizers, compost, and manure, which are key factors influencing soil health.",21
